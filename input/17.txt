Register A: 45483412
Register B: 0
Register C: 0

Program: 2,4,1,3,7,5,0,3,4,1,1,5,5,5,3,0

2 4: B = A % 8           # B can be any number from 0 to 7
1 3: B = B XOR 3         # B can be any number from 0 to 7
7 5: C = A / (2 ** B)    # C will be at most 1/2 of A and at least 1/128 of A
0 3: A = A / 8           # A is divided by 8 every loop
4 1: B = B XOR C
1 5: B = B XOR 5
5 5: OUTPUT B % 8
3 0: IF A == 0: HALT, ELSE: GOTO 0

The first loop has 2^11 different cases.
