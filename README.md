# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles.

Each year has its own branch in the repository.

## 2024

### Running the code

```bash
python3 main.py <day> [test]
```

Where `<day>` is the day number and `[test]` is an optional argument to run the code with the test input.

Sample output may look like this:

```
123
456
```

Where the first line is the answer to part one and the second line is the answer to part two.
